      "abstract": "PurposeThe digital warehouse management system is an emergence that forms a critical part of the transformation of economic structure in Industry 4.0. In the present business scenario, the warehouse management system encounters a messy layout, poor damage control, unsatisfactory order management, lack of visibility and lack of technological interventions. Digital twin (DT) based warehouse system shows the ontology and knowledge graphs for competitive advantage by consolidating and transferring goods directly from an inbound supplier to an outbound customer on short notice and with no or limited storage. There remains a lack of clarity on how the DT can be implemented successfully in warehouse management.Design/methodology/approachThe current literature remains largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of a systematic approach to integrating the research implications and analysis. This paper probes the conceptualization of the DT with the help of theoretical analysis using the systematic literature analysis method.FindingsThe study explores essential concepts such as interoperability and integrability in implementing DT. Further, it analyzes the role of a supply chain control tower (SCCT) in modern supply chain management. A research framework is proposed for practitioners and academicians by incorporating the opportunities and challenges associated with DT implementation. The research findings are mainly threefold: Conceptualization of DT, Featuring SCCT and Exploration of cross-computer platform interfaces, scalability and maintenance strategies.Originality/valueThis study is among the first to analyze and review DT applications in warehouse management. Moreover, the study proposes a theoretical toolbox for the practitioners to successfully implement the DT in warehouse DT-based warehouse management system: A theoretical toolbox for future research and applications.",

      "abstract": "This research discusses the effect of implementing a Warehouse Management System (WMS) on company continuity by coordinating and integrating other systems that will directly control the important attributes of a physical warehouse as a facility for warehouse operational activities. The aim of this research is to answer specific questions regarding the important attributes of a warehouse with optimal WMS implementation, which will have a significant impact on the company. This research was conducted using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method with references from various literature sources discussing WMS research results in the last 10 years. The results of this research state that optimal implementation of WMS in a company's warehouse will have a significant effect on the smooth running of warehouse operations, which will increase customer relationships and customer satisfaction. This happens because there are minimal errors and obstacles that will occur during the process of controlling and managing goods as a whole in the warehouse until they are sent to consumers. Optimal implementation of WMS is a more effective and efficient solution than manual warehouse management and control in the current era of technology.",

      "abstract": "The world has witnessed the digital transformation and Industry 4.0 technologies in the past decade. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of automation and digitalization in certain areas of the manufacturing industry; in particular, warehouse automation often has challenges in design and successful deployment. The effective management of the warehouse and inventory plays a pivotal role in the supply chain and production. In the literature, different architectures of Warehouse Management Systems (WMSs) and automation techniques have been proposed, but most of those have focused only on particular sections of warehouses and have lacked successful deployment. To achieve the goal of process automation, we propose an Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based architecture for real-time warehouse management by dividing the warehouse into multiple domains. Architecture viewpoints were used to present models based on the context diagram, functional view, and operational view specifically catering to the needs of the stakeholders. In addition, we present a generic IoT-based prototype system that enables efficient data collection and transmission in the proposed architecture. Finally, the developed IoT-based solution was deployed in the warehouse of a textile factory for validation testing, and the results are discussed. A comparison of the key performance parameters such as system resilience, efficiency, and latency rate showed the effectiveness of our proposed IoT-based WMS architecture.",

      "abstract": "Warehouses play an important role in the supply chain by serving as a link between producers and end consumers. Warehouses not only serve as a place to store goods, but also have other important functions. Operational efficiency and logistics control in finished goods warehouses are increasingly becoming an urgent need for companies in various industries. However, ineffective warehouse management can lead to negative impacts such as decreased profits and customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, efforts are needed to manage warehouses with good efficiency and structure. This article discusses the concept of Warehouse Management System (WMS) and finished goods warehouse management in an effort to improve operational efficiency and logistics control. Through a qualitative approach with data acquisition using literature review from various relevant sources, the relationship between the use of WMS and increased productivity in a company is examined. The results showed that there was a significant improvement in the performance of a company. The WMS is proven to increase the number of orders received and the company’s operational efficiency. WMS aids inventory management with real-time stock data, preventing shortages or excesses. Successful implementation demands proper strategy, tech utilization, planning, system integration, and employee training. Thus, WMS implementation can bring about positive changes in warehouse operational efficiency, inventory optimization, and meeting customer needs.",

The flight data and cargo information of the entity warehouse with UAV are uploaded to Ali cloud through 5G communication, and then are sent to the digital twin platform to get real-time warehouse data and visual feedback. At the same time, the instructions are sent by the digital twin platform to operate the UAV. In addition, the instructions are uploaded to Ali cloud, and then are sent to the entity warehouse through the cloud for real-time remote control of the UAV, which realizes the two-way information interaction between the virtual platform and the real platform. Ultimately, the problems of low intelligent level in the logistics warehouse management system and the dilatory feedback of goods information in warehouse are solved.",

Hence, it has become very necessary to allocate its resources efficiently and manage it effectively. A sound warehouse management system can contribute to cost reduction and improve customer satisfaction. However, traditional warehouse management system models have become unsuitable and inefficient for today's market requirements. So, companies have started to adopt innovative approaches and technologies to be used for such applications; one of these technologies is the Internet of Things that enables the connection between several physical objects and produces a massive amount of real-time data that can be transferred to useful information that helps in managing and decision making. In this paper, the architecture of this application is illustrated, its potential benefits are overviewed and a framework of implementing this technology in a warehouse is proposed. This system can help in achieving more control and monitoring on all the operations in the warehouse in real time, increase speed and efficiency and prevent counterfeiting and inventory shortage. The proposed framework can be taken as a roadmap for enterprises to improve warehouses by using the Internet of Things. Also the benefits of implementing the proposed framework and its challenges are proposed.",

As a result, a significant improvement in the signal power to noise power ratio (SNR) was achieved, ranging from 1.6 to 6.5 times, depending on the harmonic. Typically, optimizing the operation conditions of WMS-based gas sensors is based on long-term simulations, complex mathematical model analysis, and iterative experimental trials. An innovative approach based on a biological-inspired genetic algorithm (GA) and custom-made electronics for laser control is proposed. The experimental setup was equipped with a 31.23 m Heriott multipass cell, software lock-in, and algorithms to control the modulation process of the quantum cascade laser (QCL) operating in the long-wavelength-infrared (LWIR) spectral range. The research results show that the applied evolutionary approach can efficiently and precisely explore a wide range of WMS parameter combinations, enabling researchers to dramatically reduce the time needed to identify optimal settings. It took only 300 s to test approximately 1.39 × 1032 combinations of parameters for key system components. Moreover, because the system is able to check all possible component settings, it is possible to unquestionably determine the operating conditions of WMS-based gas sensors for which the limit of detection (LOD) is the most favorable.",

      "abstract": "Online detection of CO2 emissions can provide important data support for low-carbon operation of process industries. However, the cumbersome calibration process often limits the applications of gas sensors in field measurement. This article develops a total calibration-free gas detection method based on natural logarithm and linear convolution algorithms in TDLAS-WMS (ln-LC-WMS) and investigates its optimization in applications. Logarithm processing effectively eliminates the influence of light intensity on the harmonic, while linear convolution accurately quantifies the amplitude gain, which overcomes the problem of inaccurate filtering gain in the traditional demodulation method. Thereby, the harmonic is obtained with an accurate absolute amplitude that is positively correlated with gas concentration, and the gas concentration can be obtained without calibration. Meanwhile, to deal with the detection error caused by the mismatch between the preset and actual concentrations in the concentration inversion, an iterative process is generated to calculate the accurate gas concentration. To test the feasibility of the proposed method, three CO2 absorption lines near 2004 nm are applied for experimental verification. The experimental results indicate that to overcome the inaccurate preset concentration, within CO2 concentration of 5%, two iterations are sufficient to obtain the accurate result. Continuous measurements of a fixed CO2 concentration at different temperatures show high precision and stability, demonstrating that the proposed method is reliable and can obtain the gas concentration without additional calibration. The proposed method is expected to simplify the detection equipment and avoid calibration operations, which has good industrial application prospects.",

      "abstract": "Compact wearable mapping system (WMS) has gained significant attention due to their convenience in various applications. Specifically, it provides an efficient way to collect prior maps for 3D structure inspection and robot-based\"last-mile delivery\"in complex environments. However, vibrations in human motion and the uneven distribution of point cloud features in complex environments often lead to rapid drift, which is a prevalent issue when applying existing LiDAR Inertial Odometry (LIO) methods on low-cost WMS. To address these limitations, we propose a novel LIO for WMSs based on Hybrid Continuous Time Optimization (HCTO) considering the optimality of Lidar correspondences. First, HCTO recognizes patterns in human motion (high-frequency part, low-frequency part, and constant velocity part) by analyzing raw IMU measurements. Second, HCTO constructs hybrid IMU factors according to different motion states, which enables robust and accurate estimation against vibration-induced noise in the IMU measurements. Third, the best point correspondences are selected using optimal design to achieve real-time performance and better odometry accuracy. We conduct experiments on head-mounted WMS datasets to evaluate the performance of our system, demonstrating significant advantages over state-of-the-art methods. Video recordings of experiments can be found on the project page of HCTO: \\href{https://github.com/kafeiyin00/HCTO}{https://github.com/kafeiyin00/HCTO}.",

      "abstract": "The increasing reliance on data-intensive technologies in Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) has created serious data privacy issues, especially with the advent of strict regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). WMS, which are central to warehouse optimization, need to comply with changing data privacy regulations to protect sensitive customer data and maintain trust. Yet, the incorporation of GDPR into the design and functionality of WMS poses specific challenges, namely data gathering, processing, storage, and third-party transfer of data. The literature review suggests the research gap in terms of how data privacy law like GDPR impacts the design, functionality, and operational efficiency of WMS. Studies from 2015 to 2024 indicate that while GDPR has created an explosion of demand for better data security and privacy processes, the majority of WMS platforms—legacy systems in particular—are incapable of complying, especially with cross-border data flows and upholding the right to be forgotten. Furthermore, the effectiveness of privacy-by-design principles remains a challenge, requiring innovation in the realms of automation, consent management, and data anonymization. In spite of these challenges being identified, there is still limited systematic research into the long-term impact of GDPR on WMS scalability and flexibility in global supply chains. There is also a pressing need for in-depth research into how new technologies like AI and blockchain can be leveraged to meet GDPR requirements while also improving operational efficiency. This paper aims to fill these research gaps by synthesizing the literature and outlining areas of future research, thus helping organizations navigate the complex nexus of data privacy and WMS optimization.",

In this paper, we have systematically analyzed the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm’s operating mechanism in WMS-2f/1f.

Growing ESP well count and time limitation has constrained production engineers to evaluate optimization opportunity for every well manually. ESP Focus team proposed further enhancements through digitalization, especially in automating identification of optimization candidates, generating live operating envelope (OE) and developing new visualization to diagnose ESP performance.\n Well Management System (WMS) software is the source of managing well models automatically, well test validation, performance analysis, EBS evaluation and sensitivity analysis. Well Management Visualization System (WMVS) is primary real-time operation portal which manages Key performance indicators (KPI), EBS workflow, diagnostic analysis and custom reports. The proposed methodology is to perform automated sensitivity analysis using tuned well model in WMS to prepare data sets for live OE and evaluate locked in potential (LIP) to identify optimization candidates.\n New ESP diagnostic visualization is developed in WMVS by utilizing live Operating Envelope data and improving EBS to identify optimization candidates. The integration between WMS and WMVS has been established to share data between the two systems. Automatic sensitivity analysis was performed for frequency and wellhead pressure envelopes using tuned ESP well model in WMS to generate live OE along with pump recommended operating range (ROR). Operating point analysis results using daily average data was plotted along with sensitivity data and well test on P-Q chart in WMVS to monitor performance and impact of optimization.\n LIP analysis is performed on daily basis to identify optimization opportunity by considering all ESP components load limits, ROR, well inflow and water cut limitation. A pilot project is completed on a small field to test the new methodology and to plan for change management. The implementation directly impacts the rest of ESP wells and EBS KPI of all assets’ well and reservoir management (WRM) team. After thorough analysis post full implementation of project following benefits are estimated:\n 2-3% of net oil gain in ESP production. 2-man days/well of engineer's time saving from manual analysis. 25% increase in production engineer efficiency.\n The new ESP visualization has improved well performance monitoring, LIP evaluation and enabling accelerated net oil gain. A proper change management is key to the success of this project. The new enhancement in ESP surveillance and optimization using digitalization and existing technology has potential to empower production and operation engineers for addressing their production problems. Live OE and enhanced EBS will not only ease the daily task, increase surveillance scope but also help in improving their production KPIs.",

Even so, a WMS is notoriously complex to implement. Not only does the company need to ensure there is no room for error\nwhen implementing a WMS, but it also needs to integrate the WMS with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and prepare employees\nfor new technology adoption [2].\nThe success of implementation highly depends on choosing the correct wms solution that perfectly meets the business targets and fulfills operational\nneeds. An example of problem that leads to underperformance, inefficiencies and failure the strategic objectives is a mismatch between the system and\ncompany’s requirements [3]. Many challenges arise from poor preparation, inadequate stakeholder engagement and insufficient time for system testing.\nFrom the beginning, if organizations want to achieve long-term purposes with WMS implementation, they need to focus on concrete business goals [4].\nTo reduce these risks, there are some best practices that can be adopted. Related to system integration, data fidelity, and ensuring the WMS is fit for\npurpose Also, these WMS need comprehensive employee training and a well-planned change management strategy for successful compliance with the\nsystem.

Such innovations have the ability to create even more efficiencies, allowing organizations to forecast demand\nchanges, optimize inventory on a real-time basis and automate repetitive processes adding layers of functionality in WMS systems [3].\nAs such, organizations that incorporate these strategies and combine them with the newer technological advancements can elicit full benefits from WMS\nimplementation, develop cost-effective-high-performing warehousing systems capable of meeting customer demands while also achieving competitive\nadvantage in the market at a mere expense [1].",

Effective management of warehousing processes is, therefore, crucial for achieving minimal costs, maximum efficiency, and overall customer satisfaction. Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) are the first steps towards organizing these processes; however, due to the human factor involved, information on products, vehicles and workers may be missing, corrupt, or misleading. In this paper, a cost-effective Indoor Positioning System (IPS) based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology is presented for use in Intralogistics that works automatically, and therefore minimizes the possibility of acquiring incorrect data. The proposed IPS solution is intended to be used for supervising order-picker movements, movement of packages between workstations, and tracking other mobile devices in a manually operated warehouse. Only data that are accurate, reliable and represent the actual state of the system, are useful for detailed material flow analysis and optimization in Intralogistics. Using the developed solution, IPS technology is leveraged to enhance the manually operated warehouse operational efficiency in Intralogistics. Due to the hardware independence, the developed software solution can be used with virtually any BLE supported beacons and receivers. The results of IPS testing in laboratory/office settings show that up to 98% of passings are detected successfully with time delays between approach and detection of less than 0.5 s.",

      "abstract": "Background: Logistics operations are integral to manufacturing systems, particularly in the transportation processes that occur not only between facilities and stakeholders but also between warehouses and workstations within a facility. The design of functional areas and allocating goods to appropriate zones within the warehouse management system (WMS) are critical activities that substantially influence the efficiency of manufacturing logistics operations. Methods: This study develops a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to optimize material flow and product routing in manufacturing. The model identifies efficient pathways, assigns products to routes, and determines the required material-handling equipment. It is implemented in Python (3.11.5) using the Pyomo (6.7.3) package and the CBC solver (2.10.11), with sensitivity analysis performed on constraints and decision variables to evaluate robustness. Results: The findings indicate that Material Flow 3 and Material-Handling Equipment 1 represent the optimal configurations for managing the majority of goods within the manufacturing system. Conclusions: The proposed mathematical model supports the decision-making process by enabling adjustments to the proportions of functional areas within the manufacturing logistics system, ensuring operational efficiency and flexibility in response to changing demands. Furthermore, the study offers managerial insights and suggests directions for future research.",

      "abstract": "Accurate detection and estimation of pallet poses from color and depth data (RGB-D) are integral components many in advanced warehouse intelligent systems. State-of-the art object pose estimation methods follow a two-stage process, relying on off-the-shelf segmentation or object detection in the initial stage and subsequently predicting the pose of objects using cropped images. The cropped patches may include both the target object and irrelevant information, such as background or other objects, leading to challenges in handling pallets in warehouse settings with heavy occlusions from loaded objects. In this study, we propose an innovative deep learning-based approach to address the occlusion problem in pallet pose estimation from RGB-D images. Inspired by the selective attention mechanism in human perception, our developed model learns to identify and attenuate the significance of features in occluded regions, focusing on the visible and informative areas for accurate pose estimation. Instead of directly estimating pallet poses from cropped patches as in existing methods, we introduce two feature map re-weighting modules with cross-modal attention. These modules effectively filter out features from occluded regions and background, enhancing pose estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a large-scale annotated pallet dataset specifically designed to capture occlusion scenarios in warehouse environments, facilitating comprehensive training and evaluation. Experimental results on the newly collected pallet dataset show that our proposed method increases accuracy by 13.5% compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

We have considered these four technologies as exogenous constructs, and the logistics performance factors as endogenous constructs. First, we generate 23 items or indicators under those technologies and measure their loadings to determine how strongly they are linked to each technology. Next, we determine how strongly technologies are linked to logistics performance factors. Finally, we test our theoretical model using partial least squares structured equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our findings confirm that the constructs and indicators in our theoretical framework meet the criteria, supported by PLS-SEM results and fit indices.

With the advent of Industry 4.0 and its associated emerging technologies (such as cloud computing, Internet of Things, autonomous robots, etc.), a smart robotic warehouse management system is recommended. These innovations transform picking and put-away procedures in warehouses by enabling autonomous mobile robots to transition from man-to-goods to goods-to-man. A group of robots collaborate to solve problems in swarm robotics by putting together practical structures and behaviours that are similar to those found in flocks of birds, schools of fish, or swarms of bees. However, the transition to industrial applications has not yet been completed to a satisfactory level. There is a dearth of knowledge in the literature regarding real-world swarm applications that make use of swarm algorithms. Typically, swarm algorithm components—or what we call basic swarm behaviours —are used. This paper therefore discusses the opportunities available for this technology as well as the challenges that may come with their use. Finally, some possible solutions have been proposed to help tackle the identified challenges in sustainable warehouse automation.",

This study outlines a comprehensive approach for AMRs to autonomously navigate within narrow aisles of a warehouse, ensuring safety and streamlining order completion. The goal is to independently collect and transport bins with products referred to the order, to the workstation area, where workers finalize order packing. Precise positioning of fiducial markers on the floor, initiates a fusion-based localization system that merges information from wheel odometry and fiducial detection. The markers are organized as an undirected graph to facilitate navigation purposes and Dijkstra algorithm is employed to successfully generate both safe and optimal paths. A pipeline has been established for the retrieval and positioning of bins from shelves or workstations to optimize the order picking process. The proposed method has been tested on a simulation environment with realistic constraints stem from the development of an autonomous warehouse environment.",

This paper proposes a novel customization of a multi-robot system, called Tactile Mobile Manipulators (TacMMs). Each TacMM integrates a soft optical tactile sensor and a mobile robot with a load-lifting mechanism, enabling cooperative transportation in tasks requiring coordinated physical interaction. More specifically, we mount the TacTip (biomimetic optical tactile sensor) on the Distributed Organisation and Transport System (DOTS) mobile robot. The tactile information then helps the mobile robots adjust the relative robot-object pose, thereby increasing the efficiency of load-lifting tasks. This study compares the performance of using two TacMMs with tactile perception with traditional vision-based pose adjustment for load-lifting. The results show that the average success rate of the TacMMs (66%) is improved over a purely visual-based method (34%), with a larger improvement when the mass of the load was non-uniformly distributed. Although this initial study considers two TacMMs, we expect the benefits of tactile perception to extend to multiple mobile robots.",

The aim is to analyse the use of AGVs in our country and abroad and to provide information about the use of AGVs in other countries and operations other than ours. The result of the analysis was a literature review, which points out the individual advantages and disadvantages of the use of AGVs in companies. Within the review we also address the issue of AMR vehicles, due to the modernization of existing AGVs in the company, or the replacement of AMRs with AGVs in general. Our aim is to show why AGVs can replace human work. This is mainly because of the continuous increase in the wages of employees, because of safety, but also because of the modernization of the selected company. The company has positive experience of AGVs in other sites. We wanted to point out a higher form of automation, and how it would be possible to use AMR vehicles for the same work as AGVs. In the company, we have identified jobs where we would like to introduce AGVs or AMR vehicles. Consequently, we chose the AGV from CEIT operated by magnetic tape and the AMR from SEER as an example. Based on studies, the demand for AGVs is expected to increase by up to 17% in 2019–2024. Therefore, the company is looking into the issue of the implementation of AGVs at multiple sites. The question which remains is the economic return and the possibility of investing in the automation of processes in the company, which we discuss in more detail in the conclusion of the article and in the research. The article describes the exact processes for AGVs, their workload, and also the routes for AGVs, such as loading/unloading points, stopping points, checkpoints, junctions with other AGVs, charging stations, and field elements, as well as their speed, frequency and the possibility of collision with other AGVs. Our research shows that by applying the new technology, the company will save a large amount of money on employee wages. The purchase of two AGVs will cost the company EUR 49,000, while the original technology used in the company cost EUR 79,200 annually. The payback period for such an investment is 8 months. The benefits of implementing AGVs are evaluated in the last section of this paper, where both the economic and time requirements of the different proposals are included. This section also includes recommendations for improving specific parts of the enterprise.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel approach for investigating optimization performance by flexible robot co-ordination in automated warehouses with multi-agent rein-forcement learning (MARL)-based control. Automated systems using robots are expected to achieve efficient operations compared with manual systems in terms of overall optimization performance. However, the impact of overall optimization on performance remains unclear in most automated systems due to a lack of suitable control methods. Thus, we proposed a centralized training-and-decentralized execution MARL frame-work as a practical overall optimization control method. In the proposed framework, we also proposed a single shared critic, trained with global states and rewards, applicable to a case in which heterogeneous agents make decisions asynchronously. Our proposed MARL framework was applied to the task selection of material handling equipment through automated order picking simulation, and its performance was evaluated to determine how far overall optimization outperforms partial optimization by comparing it with other MARL frameworks and rule-based control methods.",

      "abstract": "The smart city is an integrated environment that heavily relies on intelligent robots, which provides the basis for the warehouse automation. However, a warehouse is a typical unstructured environment, and robotic grasp and manipulation are extremely important for the package, transfer, search, and so on. Currently, the most usual method is to detect the picking or grasping points for some specific end-effector including suction cup, gripper, or robotic hand. The manipulation performance is, therefore, strongly influenced by the visual detector. To tackle this problem, the affordance map has recently been developed. It characterizes the operation possibilities afforded by the operation scene and has been used for several grasp tasks. Nevertheless, the conventional affordance method often fails in complicated environments due to the mistake calculation results. In this article, we develop a novel framework to integrate the interactive exploration with a composite robotic hand for robotic grasping in a complicated environment. The exploration strategy is obtained by a deep reinforcement learning procedure. The developed new composite hand, which integrates the suction cup and grippers, is used to test the merits of the proposed interactive perception method. Experimental results show the proposed method significantly increases the manipulation efficiency and may bring great economic and social and benefits for smart cities.",
