      "abstract": "Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) have recently acquired a lot of interest in the academic research field and industry applications due to a variety of advantages, including increased mobility and improved safety. AGVs are designed to maneuver following a predetermined path; however, if the path is blocked, how can the AGV avoid or pass through it by selecting the new path with the safest behavior? This article discovered a number of recent advanced methods that are widely employed in AGV operation with the aim of avoiding dynamic obstacles and being able to function in a complex environment. The most recent techniques for obstacle avoidance utilized with AGV have been evaluated in scholarly research that has been published in the last five years. In doing so, this review responds to three related questions: are the fundamental approaches for avoiding obstacles in AGV robot systems still applicable? 2) which is the most recent sensor technology used by the AGV robot to sense its surroundings? and 3) does the artificial intelligence (AI) method improve the AGV robot’s ability to make decisions and function autonomously? As a result, various fundamental and recent advances in methods are covered. This study is done to make it easier for researchers or engineers to comprehend and conduct more research.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) method based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), aimed at enhancing the trajectory tracking performance of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in complex dynamic environments. Traditional physical models often face the challenges of computational inefficiency and insufficient control precision when dealing with complex dynamic systems. However, by integrating physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks, PINNs can effectively learn and capture the kinematic characteristics of vehicles, replacing traditional nonlinear ordinary differential equation models and thus significantly enhancing computational efficiency and control performance. During the model-training phase, this study further incorporates the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) and adaptive loss balancing strategies to efficiently solve ODE problems without relying on numerical integration and optimize the control strategy. This combined approach not only reduces computational complexity, but also improves the robustness and precision of the control strategy in varying environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this method offers significant advantages in AGV trajectory-tracking tasks, manifested in higher computational efficiency and precise control performance. The proposal of the PINN-MPC method provides new theoretical support and innovative methods for real-time complex system control, with important research and application potential, and is expected to play a key role in future intelligent control systems.",

      "abstract": "In the Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS), where material processing is carried out in the form of tasks from one department to another, the use of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) is significant. The application of multiple-load AGVs can be understood to boost FMS throughput by multiple orders of magnitude. For the transportation of materials and items inside a warehouse or manufacturing plant, an AGV, a mobile robot, offers extraordinary industrial capabilities. The technique of allocating AGVs to tasks while taking into account the cost and time of operations is known as AGV scheduling. Most research has exclusively addressed single-objective optimization, whereas multi-objective scheduling of AGVs is a complex combinatorial process without a single solution, in contrast to single-objective scheduling. This paper presents the integrated Local Search Probability-based Memetic Water Cycle (LSPM-WC) algorithm using a spinning mill as a case study. The scheduling model’s goal is to maximize machine efficiency. The scheduling of the statistical tests demonstrated the applicability of the proposed model in lowering the makespan and fitness values. The mean AGV operating efficiency was higher than the other estimated models, and the LSPM-WC surpassed the different algorithms to produce the best result.",

The decision to use AGV navigation is not straightforward, even if it appears appropriate and sufficient. This paper surveys the navigation approaches applied to AGV in the past five years of published academic research. In doing so, this work responds to three related questions: 1) are the AGV’s classical navigation techniques still relevant to the current application area?; 2) are heuristic navigation techniques themselves able to optimize AGV movement in terms of guide and strategy?; and 3) is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in AGV navigation techniques able to increase system performance? As a result, numerous techniques for AGV navigation have been developed globally. On the other hand, the most popular navigation approaches are provided below for more research.",

      "abstract": "Because they are environmentally friendly and safe, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are increasingly used in newly constructed automated container terminals. However, their scheduling strategy is constrained by their limited battery capacity. When batteries reach their charging threshold, the AGVs need to be returned to battery-swapping stations. Moreover, the movement speed of AGVs has a significant impact on their energy consumption and operating times. Therefore, in this paper, a speed control strategy that considers the traffic environment of the terminal is proposed from the perspective of energy conservation and emission reduction. In addition, the charging capacity of the terminal is discretized to model its limited handling capacity to avoid congestion in the battery-swapping stations. To minimize the costs of delays and carbon emissions of AGV operations, a mixed integer programming model is established. It optimizes the efficiency and carbon emissions of the operations by assigning and prioritizing container transportation and AGV battery-swapping tasks. An improved genetic algorithm-based approach is designed where a better initial solution is obtained through a greedy strategy, while simulated annealing is adopted for population selection to prevent the algorithm from falling into local optima. Furthermore, an adaptive adjustment strategy for crossover and mutation probabilities is adopted to improve the algorithm’s convergence. Finally, a series of numerical experiments is conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that considering the variability of AGV speed can more accurately characterize their energy consumption, and increasing the number of AGVs and enhancing the battery-swapping capacity can effectively reduce the costs of delays and carbon emissions.",

Specifically, based on the analysis of AGV body structure and motion state, transport distance and energy consumption are selected as two optimization objectives. According to the characteristics and application context of the problem, this paper designs a hybrid genetic algorithm with large neighborhood search (GA-LNS) considering the farthest insertion heuristic. GA-LNS is improved by increasing the local search ability of genetic algorithm to enhance the solution optimal quality. Extensive computational experiments which are generated from Solomon’s benchmark instances and a real case of FMS are designed to evaluate and demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The experimental results reveal that compared with using the traditional homogeneous fleet, the heterogeneous multitype AGV fleet transportation mode has a huge energy-saving potential in workshop intralogistics.",

The proposed manual coding landmark significantly improves the decoding speed and accuracy while ensuring the information coding capacity. An improved heuristic path planning algorithm combined with the visual sensor system is implemented, considering the planning effectiveness and directionality. Finally, simulations and experiments verify the reliability of the visual guidance method in position measurement and the advancement of the planning strategy. Compared with the traditional 2-D code and bottom visual model, the improved visual sensor position measurement effectively reduces motion blur and corresponding pose deviation. The decoding speed and accuracy are improved by more than 41.21% and 53.85%, respectively. Planning performance comparison is achieved between the same type of heuristic algorithms (A*, D*, and algorithm deployment). The significant improvement in core system indicators includes task efficiency (up to 70.02% improvement), parking time (up to 72% reduction), deadlock (up to 85.05% reduction), and planning time (up to 89.39% reduction).",

      "abstract": "Order picker routing refers to the process of collecting a set of products with the minimum travel time. Recently, a new generation of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) has been developed to assist human order pickers in order to minimize their travel time. These vehicles are using battery as energy source. However, the routing energy efficiency aspect of these systems remains unexplored. Yet any improvement in power consumption will ultimately reduce the DOD (depth of discharge) of the battery and increase its lifespan. For example, in many real AGV applications incorporating the effect of load mass has been neglected, although its importance. In most studies, the methodology proposed for the order picking routing problem does not allow neither the integration of the mass of each Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) nor the calculation of associated energy costs. Those studies are generally limited to ensure that all the items requested by an order are picked up with minimum travel time/distance. In this paper, an Energy Efficient Order Picking Routing algorithm named EE-OPR is proposed to realize an efficient AGV tour with an acceptable trade-off between energy preservation and travel time minimization. The proposed approach takes into account the mass of loads and its accumulation throughout the pick tour since it intensifies the rolling resistance losses on flat ground, especially at lower speeds. In this regard, an optimization method by means of dynamic states graph is developed. This method is applied to different warehouse layouts. The performance of the suggested algorithm is evaluated by comparing it with an approach minimizing only travel time consumption. Results show that the optimized tours, offered by EE-OPR are effective and robust, with an 18% average saving on the total cost of picking tour.",

In the first, the image of the room is processed by heuristics to locate the robot’s target - the palette. The found pattern allows one to locate the destination as well as create a mask. The mask can be used to train the U-Net network. When a network is trained, the use of heuristics for pallet location can be omitted.

      "abstract": "In industrial environments, over several decades, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) have served to improve efficiencies of intralogistics and material handling tasks. However, for system integrators, the choice and effective deployment of improved, suitable and reliable communication and control technologies for these unmanned vehicles remains a very challenging task. Specifics of communication for AGVs and AMRs imposes stringent performance requirements on latency and reliability of communication links which many existing wireless technologies struggle to satisfy. In this paper, a review of latest AGVs and AMRs research results in the past decade is presented. The review encompasses results from different past and present research domains of AGVs. In addition, performance requirements of communication networks in terms of their latencies and reliabilities when they are deployed for AGVs and AMRs coordination, control and fleet management in smart manufacturing environments are discussed. Integration challenges and limitations of present state-of-the-art AGV and AMR technologies when those technologies are used for facilitating AGV-based smart manufacturing and factory of the future applications are also thoroughly discussed. The paper also present a thorough discussion of areas in need of further research regarding the application of 5G networks for AGVs and AMRs fleet management in smart manufacturing environments. In addition, novel integration ideas by which tactile Internet, 5G network slicing and virtual reality applications can be used to facilitate AGV and AMR based factory of the future (FoF) and smart manufacturing applications were motivated.",

However, the integration of fleets of AGVs into existing production facilities still poses challenges. In this paper, a data-driven digital twin model of a system of AGVs is developed. It is based on an analysis of real-time data to replicate the driving behavior of individual vehicles as well as transport order management, vehicle selection, and travel process control more accurately. For the use case of a hybrid flow shop preassembly, the digital twin is used to optimize the number of AGVs required for the target throughput of the factory as well as to compare and select suitable path network topologies. Thus, the digital twin of a system of AGVs can be seen as a tool to increase productivity. Due to the modular design and flexible interfaces, the digital twin can easily be applied in other production scenarios as well.",

      "abstract": "Automated guided vehicle (AGV) smart parking provides a new solution to solve the problem of urban parking difficulties. In the AGV parking lot, whether the AGV running path is reasonable affects the transportation efficiency of the entire parking lot. RRT algorithm and ant colony algorithm can achieve good path planning effect for AGV. However, the use of uniformly distributed initial pheromones can easily lead to blind search and local optimization in the early stage of the algorithm, resulting in a decrease in AGV efficiency. In this paper, an AGV based on the fast-scaling random tree-ant colony algorithm (RRT*-ACO) is proposed. The path planning method uses the fast search mechanism of RRT* algorithm and the positive feedback advantage of ant colony algorithm to combine the two algorithms and add them to the RRT* algorithm. The two-way search, heuristic dynamic sampling and dynamic step size strategies are used to accelerate the search speed of the RRT* algorithm, quickly generate an initial path, and then deploy different concentrations of initial pheromones according to the initial path to guide the ant colony algorithm search. Then, the silo excavation search strategy is added to the ant colony algorithm, which improves the pheromone update rule and reduces the number of iterations of the ant colony algorithm. Finally, several simulation experiments are carried out on the algorithm in maps of different scales, and the comparative experimental results show that the RRT*-ACO algorithm has faster convergence speed, better global search ability, and the path planning efficiency is significantly higher than that of traditional ant colony algorithm and ant colony system, and has better robustness in large-scale maps.",

The whole approach is applied to an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) in order to avoid the problems of many nodes, long-distance and large turning angle, and these problems usually exist in the sawtooth and cross paths produced by the traditional A-star algorithm. First, a grid method models a port environment. Second, the nodes in the close-list are filtered by the functions <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$P\\left ({{x,y} }\\right)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$W\\left ({{x,y} }\\right)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and the nodes that do not meet the requirements are removed to avoid the generation of irregular paths. Simultaneously, to enhance the stability of the AGV regarding turning paths, the polyline at the turning path is replaced by a cubic B-spline curve. The path planning experimental results applied to different scenarios and different specifications showed that compared with other seven different algorithms, the geometric A-star algorithm reduces the number of nodes by 10% ~ 40%, while the number of turns is reduced by 25%, the turning angle is reduced by 33.3%, and the total distance is reduced by 25.5%. Overall, the simulation results of the path planning confirmed the effectiveness of the geometric A-star algorithm.",

      "abstract": "To address the issues with traditional genetic algorithm (GA) path planning, which often results in redundant path nodes and local optima, we propose an Improved Genetic Algorithm that incorporates an ant colony algorithm (ACO). Firstly, a new population initialization method is proposed. This method adopts a higher-quality random point generation strategy to generate random points centrally near the start and end of connecting lines. It combines the improved ACO algorithm to connect these random points quickly, thus greatly improving the quality of the initial population. Secondly, path smoothness constraints are proposed in the adaptive function. These constraints reduce the large-angle turns and non-essential turns, improving the smoothness of the generated path. The algorithm integrates the roulette and tournament methods in the selection stage to enhance the searching ability and prevent premature convergence. Additionally, the crossover stage introduces the edit distance and a two-layer crossover operation based on it to avoid ineffective crossover and improve convergence speed. In the mutation stage, we propose a new mutation method and introduce a three-stage mutation operation based on the idea of simulated annealing. This makes the mutation operation more effective and efficient. The three-stage mutation operation ensures that the mutated paths also have high weights, increases the diversity of the population, and avoids local optimality. Additionally, we added a deletion operation to eliminate redundant nodes in the paths and shorten them. The simulation software and experimental platform of ROS (Robot Operating System) demonstrate that the improved algorithm has better path search quality and faster convergence speed. This effectively prevents the algorithm from maturing prematurely and proves its effectiveness in solving the path planning problem of AGV (automated guided vehicle).",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of the economy and the continuous improvement of people’s living standards, the printing and packaging industry plays an increasingly important role in people’s lives. The traditional printing industry is a discrete manufacturing industry, relying on a large amount of manpower and manual operation, low production efficiency, higher labor costs, wasting of resources, and other issues, so the realization of printing factory intelligence to improve the competitiveness of the industry is an important initiative. Automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) are an important part of an intelligent factory, serving the function of automatic transportation of materials and products. To optimize the movement paths of AGVs, enhance safety, and improve transportation efficiency and productivity, this paper proposes an alternative implementation of the A* algorithm. The proposed algorithm improves search efficiency and path smoothness by incorporating the grid obstacle rate and enhancing the heuristic function within the A* algorithm’s evaluation function. This introduces the evaluation subfunction of the nearest distance between the AGV, the known obstacle, and the unknown obstacle in the global path in the dynamic window approach (DWA algorithm), and reduces the interference of obstacles with the AGV in global path planning. Finally, the two improved algorithms are combined into a new fusion algorithm. The experimental results show that the search efficiency of the fusion algorithm significantly improved and the transportation time shortened. The path smoothness significantly improved, and the closest distance to obstacles increased, reducing the risk of collision. It can thus effectively improve the productivity of an intelligent printing factory and enhance its flexibility.",

In response, we present an improved A-star based path planning algorithm. Our approach addresses these challenges by incorporating innovative modifications to the cost function, dynamically adjusting weights based on diverse turning angles to curtail unnecessary turns. Additionally, we integrate the artificial potential field method, introducing a unique heuristic function. This function includes a penalty term accounting for obstacle information at turning points, ensuring that these points are strategically positioned away from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison to traditional A-star algorithms.

Traditional path planning techniques, while effective in static or less complex environments, often fail to address the dynamic and uncertain conditions present in facilities utilizing multiple AGVs. This paper investigates the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) as a novel approach to overcome these challenges, offering a promising avenue for optimizing multi-AGV path planning. By treating AGVs as agents that learn optimal strategies through environmental interactions, MARL facilitates a nuanced consideration of both individual actions and the interplay between multiple agents. This study synthesizes recent advancements in MARL applications for AGV path planning, highlighting significant contributions, such as the development of enhanced algorithms for various operational scenarios and the introduction of the RFM-AGV algorithm. The latter focuses on crucial aspects of MARL design—convergence, learning speed, and scalability—demonstrating its effectiveness in cooperative tasks through theoretical analysis and comparative experiments. This work not only showcases the potential of MARL in revolutionizing AGV path planning but also sets the stage for future research directions in the logistics and manufacturing sectors.",

Regarding the connection of production processes in the workshop, that is, AGV can achieve path planning and obstacle avoidance strategies in the face of dynamic and complex scenes during material handling, firstly, based on the production layout in the workshop, a neighborhood weighted grid modeling method is used to reduce the path offset error caused by the large speed difference between adjacent grid units in the grid model, and construct a more reasonable grid map. Then, on the basis of the grid map, the deep Q learning algorithm is used to achieve AGV path planning. The traditional algorithm introduces the method of updating the data in the experience pool and improving the direction reward function to solve the dimensional disaster and low learning efficiency of the deep Q learning algorithm in unknown environments. The, Due to issues such as poor robustness of planning strategies, a reasonable AGV path was obtained through simulation experiments, while improving the calculation speed and accuracy of the algorithm.\n ",

      "abstract": "The window strategy, known for its flexibility and efficiency, is extensively used in dynamic path planning. To further enhance the performance of the Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) sorting system, the two processes of AGV movement and path planning can be executed concurrently based on the window strategy. Nonetheless, difficulties in matching the computing time of the planning server with the moving time of AGVs may cause delays or reduced path optimality. To address the problem, this paper proposes an optimal time reuse strategy. The proposed solution controls computing time by managing path length for each planning instance, ensuring alignment with the moving time of AGVs to maximize path optimality and avoid delays. To achieve this, two aspects need to be considered. Firstly, on a systemic level, we control the entry rate of AGVs by adjusting the replanning period, thus avoiding congestion caused by excessive AGVs and maintaining high system efficiency. Secondly, we reversely control the computing time by adjusting the path length that needs to be planned for each single planning, so that it matches the moving time of AGVs. Simulation results show that our method outperforms existing top-performing methods, achieving task completion rates 1.64, 1.57, and 1.12 times faster across various map sizes. This indicates its effectiveness in synchronizing planning and movement times. The method contributes significantly to dynamic path planning methodologies, offering a novel approach to time management in AGV systems.",

The traditional A* algorithm is improved internally and externally. In the internal improvement process, we propose an improved node search method within the A* algorithm to avoid generating invalid paths; offer a heuristic function which uses diagonal distance instead of traditional heuristic functions to reduce the number of turns in the path; and add turning weights in the A* algorithm formula, further reducing the number of turns in the path and reducing the number of node searches. In the process of external improvement, the output path of the internally improved A* algorithm is further optimized externally by the improved forward search optimization algorithm and the Bessel curve method, which reduces path length and turns and creates a path with fewer turns and a shorter distance. The experimental results demonstrate that the internally modified A* algorithm suggested in this research performs better when compared to six conventional path planning methods. Based on the internally improved A* algorithm path, the full improved A* algorithm reduces the turning angle by approximately 69% and shortens the path by approximately 10%; based on the simulation results, the improved A* algorithm in this paper can reduce the running time of AGV and improve the logistics efficiency in the workshop. Specifically, the walking time of AGV on the improved A* algorithm path is reduced by 12s compared to the traditional A* algorithm.",
