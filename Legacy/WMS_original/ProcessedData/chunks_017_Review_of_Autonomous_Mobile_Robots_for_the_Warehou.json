One of the most common sensors used in industry is LiDAR. The sensor works\nby sending out a known waveform into a scene, it is then reflected off of an object,\nand the LiDAR receiver captures a portion of the waveform and estimates the time\nit took, which distance is then derived from [11]. The sensors are very accurate and\ncan have a working range of .05m to 25m [12]. Some LiDAR sensors rely on artificial\nlandmarks, like reflective surfaces, already placed in the warehouse.
