An inventory mana-\ngement system should also contribute to realization of this basic aim. Many current\nasset management models currently found in financial management literature were\nconstructed with the assumption of book profit maximization as basic aim. However\nthese models could lack what relates to another aim, i.e., maximization of enterprise\nvalue. This article presents a modified value-based inventory management model.

Excess cash\ntied up in inventory burdens the enterprise with high costs of inventory service and\nopportunity costs. By contrast, higher inventory stock helps increase income from\nsales because customers have greater flexibility in making purchasing decisions and\nthe firm decrease risk of unplanned break of production.
