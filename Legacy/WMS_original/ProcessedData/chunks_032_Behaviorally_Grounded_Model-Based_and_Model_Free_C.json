Among one of the more\nstudied consequences of the interaction of behavioral heuristics and supply chain structure\nis the emergence of instability as embodied by the ‘bullwhip effect’ (Croson et al., 2014;\nForrester, 1961; Lee et al., 2004). Bullwhip refers to the increasing amplitudes in both\norders and on-hand inventory positions of members of a multi-echelon supply chain the\nfurther one moves away from a source of order variability.

And while often viewed as a ‘classical’ problem\nin Operations Management, recent worldwide experiences with supply chain shortages and\nexcesses induced by the Coronavirus pandemic for consumer goods, foodstuffs and medical\nsupplies, have catapulted the term ‘bullwhip’ into the popular consciousness (see for\nexample: Bamakan et al., 2021; Evenett, 2021; Hockett, 2020; Johnson, 2021; Shih, 2020;\nStank et al., 2021)\nOptimal control policies in multi-echelon supply chains are well understood and\nwell-studied.",

These prior explorations of the causes of ordering amplification and phase shift,\nand the resulting suggested interventions, rely on developing an underlying model of\nhuman ordering behavior (as in the case of the Sterman, Corson & Donohue, and Wu and\nKatok work) or on explicitly modeling the supply chain structure and information\nnetwork (as in the case of the classical Clark and Scarf or even the more recent Hau\nwork).
